    "Based on the data, there are a total of 24 columns. Most of the information in the data are numeric. However, there are numerous cells that have missing values (or \"..\"). Overall, I would say that it may be a bit difficult or challenging to analyze the data because  the data is arranged according to periods. To further clean the data, it would be easier to arrange the data according to their geolocation. This way, it would be easier to find the quarterly breakdown of the data per region. However, if the focus is on the periods, and not the geolocation, the arrangement of the data would be enough. Some changes that can be added to the data would be the removal of the \"..\"s at the beginning of the geolocations and replacing \"..\"s under the dataset with zeroes. It is also important to arrange the columns according to thie classification. For example, Total Number, Residential Number, Non-residential Number, Additions Number, Alterations/Repairs/Renovations Number, Demolitions Number, and Street furnitures Number should be next to each other. By doing so, the data would be easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a multi-index could also be another great way to arrange the data. So instead of having the years as data, it can be considered as the first index. The next index could be the periods. By combining these two and creating a multi-indx, the data would look less intimidating for those who would like to analyze it.\n",
